## Core

* [ ] Dynamic linking
* [ ] CI
* [ ] Built-in modules
* [ ] Conanfile (for interface purposes; exporting headers through Conan)
* [ ] Testing
* [ ] API
* [ ] Packaging

## Dynamic linking
* [x] Linking core + flag resolution

## CI
* [x] Build
* [ ] Make the CI run tests

## Built-in modules
* [ ] HelpModule

## API
* [ ] Encryption
* [ ] Interaction with other programs
* [ ] Modules of modules
* [ ] Lua interface
* [ ] On-demand module loading (will require a JSON file to be accompanied with each module for early resolution purposes)

## Testing
* [ ] Set up testing
* [ ] Test dynamic loading and `NovaMain()`

Other testing is on a per-need basis, and doesn't need to be listed here. Test when necessary and useful.

## Packaging
* [ ] .deb
* [ ] .exe
* [ ] generic linux (x64, fuck 32 bit)
* [ ] Whatever macOS uses? Might also be a thing to backlog, can't test portability on this
