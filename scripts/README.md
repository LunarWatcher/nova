# Scripts

This folder will eventually contain several scripts related to Nova, assuming more are necessary.

Currently, only novacd exists, which is a wrapper around `cd $(nova whatever)`. Not exactly a fan of it, but it's the best I can do without relying heavily on context-dependent output. It's a bot - could output a path without the intention being to cd.
